Solutions could be
- Heuristic
- ?

#### Reasonable for a QC
What it should not have:
- Very large qubit count
- Very deep circuits
- Needs error correction
What it should have:
- Most use of most of the qubits on a QPU
- Circuits can be improved with error mitigation
- An obvious extension to future application that might see quantum advantage.
